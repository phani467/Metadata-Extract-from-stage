    <subject>Your IHS Markit Customer Care Case {!Case.CaseNumber} -  Request for additional information</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Contact},

In order to investigate your case we need the following information: 

- MarkitWire username of the person/Dealsink/API having the issue? 
- Markitwire software version? 
- Is this a new user? 
- Does the user have a new pc? 
- Have any other changes occurred that are unique to the user? 
- Is anyone else in the office having similar issues? 

As well as answering these questions, could you also please obtain the client logs from the user when they receive this error (see attached document). 

I will then escalate the matter to my colleagues in the Engineering Services department. 

Regards,
