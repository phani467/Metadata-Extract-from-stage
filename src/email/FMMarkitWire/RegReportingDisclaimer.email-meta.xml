    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Contact}, 

Please note that LE-LE static settings for Real-time and Regulatory Reporting that may be applicable to these changes HAVE NOT been setup. 

These include Counterparty Non-disclosure, Indication of Collateralisation and RCP override. 

If you require these to be set-up for the newly permissioned LE-LE pair these will need to be requested via email to regreporting@markitserv.com by your designated Regulatory Reporting Admin.
