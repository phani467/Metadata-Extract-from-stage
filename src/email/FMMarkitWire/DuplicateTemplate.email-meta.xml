    <subject>Your IHS Markit Customer Care Case {!Case.CaseNumber} - Closed as Duplicate</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Contact},

As a courtesy notice the above case has been closed as it is a duplicate of {!Case.Parent}. The duplicate case was created by the system because the long case reference, for the case in question, was omitted from your email. The system automatically logged a new call as a result.

For future reference, when referring to a specific call, please ensure that the long call reference is included in your email. For example; {!Case.Thread_Id} . The long call reference can be found in either the subject line of an email or in the footer of the initial case acknowledgement response.


Thank you,
{!Case.OwnerFullName}
