    <subject>Your IHS Markit Customer Care Case {!Case.CaseNumber} - Bloomberg News - Access to Markit Securities Finance Data</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Contact},

You now have access to the Markit Securities Finance data on Bloomberg.
Please contact our Media team msf-media@markit.com before publishing any Markit Securities Finance content. They will help navigate the key fields and send you a simple User Guide created by the Bloomberg News team.
There are many Markit Securities Finance fields available and we recommend that Bloomberg journalists focus on the following when writing about short interest and long flow using this data:
DX Short Interest % Shares Outstanding - shows the percentage of the company based on the free float that is sold short. This is the main measure of short interest and should be sufficient for most articles.
DX Long Inventory Supply % of Shares Outstanding - shows the percentage of the company based on the shares outstanding that institutional lenders are making available to be borrowed.
DX Utilization Quantity - shows the amount of stock on loan as a percentage of the lendable supply. This can be a complicated concept to explain. We recommend that it is not used in isolation but in conjunction with the Short Interest % Shares Outstanding to provide more colour.
Note - Please be aware that in some regions, dividend arbitrage trading takes place +/- 30 days from the dividend record date. This can materially impact the percentage of shares outstanding on loan and should always be considered when writing about short interest. A hedging arbitrage can also occur if a company has issued convertible bonds
The Media team can also send you bespoke Data Explorers EQS and RV screens which can be configured to screen short interest and long flow in indices, countries or sectors.

If you require any additional assistance, please contact us on live chat, email or phone.

Thank You.
