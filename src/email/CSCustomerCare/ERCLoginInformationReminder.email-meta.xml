    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Contact}

Your request for your login information has been received. For your reference we have created case ID : {!Case.Case Number}
.
Login is a two-step process :
Step 1 : Account Level Login – This is your company or organization’s login credential
Step 2 : User Level Login – This is your individual login credential
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 - Account Login (This is NOT your individual user login credential) :
· Many companies use a blind login link to authenticate this, which can be found on your company&apos;s network. While others use their direct company Account Login credentials.
· Due to security measures, IHS cannot supply the Account Level login credentials directly.
· Do not bookmark the intranet blind login link for usage, as it may not work if the account is updated due to administrative reasons.
· If you have any issues with accessing the intranet link or require the company Account Level login instead, please refer to the internal contact point below who manages the login details.
The
{!Case.Account}
point of contact is :
{point of contact name from SSO}
, please refer to your company directory for the accurate contact details.
Your organization&apos;s intranet login page URL is : *Note to CC - copy and paste redirect link here if one is listed in PACS, else delete the complete intranet section*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 - User Login :
· Enter your full corporate email address and password under Returning Registered Users if you have previously registered.
· If you have never registered, click &quot;Register&quot; under New User or Never Registered.
· To retrieve your individual login password, &quot;The Forgot your password&quot; link is located on this page as well.
· Due to security measures, IHS cannot supply the User Level login credentials directly.
*Please note that your user password is case sensitive*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· If you continue to have issues accessing the IHS ERC please reply to this email and we will work to resolve your issue.
